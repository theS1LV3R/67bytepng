# 67 Byte PNG

Back in 2007, Gareth Rees made an amazing [article][article_url] ([archived][archived_url]) on how to make the smallest possible PNG, and the byte-level reasoning behind it. I figured the full code deserved to be put on the internet, so here it is :)

The article has also been saved to [`article.md`](./article.md), just in case.

Here is the png itself: ![67 byte png](./67bytepng.png).
